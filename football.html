    <h1> Football Life </h1>
    <h3>
     After looking at my home page and seeing my weight and height you'd probably never picture me playing football. I started off my first year of football at City Rec, with a team called the "Rowdy Boys" I played quarterback, as sore as I was every night going home, I loved that position. Even though I was playing 12 unlimited. After going maybe 1-9 in the season I was recruited by a new team called the "Hardhitters" another team in the City Rec organization. My first year playing with them we had went to the superbowl and won. We received a nice trophy, as you can see the one below. Made a lot of new long term friends, but sadly. As years passed our head coach had passed away. After playing 3 years of City Rec football, I didn't really see myself playing in High School. However, I started back playing my Junior and Senior year of high school.I planned on playing my sophomore year but during a practice, we were doing 1on1 with a runnerback and someone on the opposite side, I was the person tackling.. I went in head first and was laid out gasping for breathe, although the team and coaches didn't know because they were excited about the compact of the tackle. Days later I realized that I had a stage 3 concussion. After a couple of weeks I was good, didn't go back that year. We won our PHL championship game my senior year, but lost next round. I played wide receiver, free safety, kickoff and kickoff return. We had a really good team. Although I went through a major injury, it made me atough person today.
