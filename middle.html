        Gateway Middle School, Man Man Man.. I could remember it like it was yesterday, from my teachers, to my classmates, to the principal, to the basketball games, to even the nasty lunch. Gateway was the school to be at back then, our rivals were Carr Lane, which were right across the street. I remember a day that I was sent to the office, Now that I think about those times, I can't do anything but laugh. My 6th grade year, in basketball we went undefeated. 7th grade I don't think I played, and 8th grade was when we went to state, but I also don't think I played then either. I had my first girlfriend in middle school. Or maybe second. There were a lot of good memories and bad, but it made me who I am today.
