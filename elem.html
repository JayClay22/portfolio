                I feel as if I can remember the first day going to Jefferson Elementary. I feel like I can remember the outfit I wore that day, the breakfast I ate that day, and seeing my so many new faces, as nervous as I was. My home room teacher name was Ms. Lowe, she was really nice, but at times she could get mean, just as long as you stayed on her good side. The best times was lunch, recess and gym class. Everything else, I was just waiting for time to pass by. However, that's about as much as I remember from those days, I had a  lot of good times and a lot of bad times.
