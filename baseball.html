    <h1>
        Baseball Life 
    </h1>
    <h3>
        It all started when I was about 8 years old playing with the Blue Jays... I always played up, they were all like 10 and 11 and I was always the youngest on the team. Had the biggest uniform on, and was hoping that someone wouldn't show up to the gamae so I could play. I remember a time from the game when the coaches, which were my uncles told me to bend all the way down when I went to the plate so everything would be called a ball. I also rememner a time when we played in Illinois and I hit the ball into center field.. I'll never forget that moment. As time went on I continued to play baseball. I played on summer league teams and more. My first year of high school I played at Soldan International High School, I played third base.. They called me "slingshot"... But we had a pretty good team, we lost in first round but we played pretty good. My next three years I played at Vashon high school we also had a really good team, as my senior year came along we lost first round to Career Academy. I believe it was because we didn't have our coach, he had to go out of town becuase of a unexpected incident. But I was the last strikeout to end the game, so I could not sleep that night... However I told myself that career in baseball wasn't gonna end that night, I wanted to continue playing in college, so I went out and tried out for third base... Although the team was already stacked I figured I could get some playing time, but after a week of practice I wasan't feeling it anymore so I went and talked to the head coach and told him that I was thankful for the opportunity but wanted to stop. So that was the end of my baseball career.
