    <h1>College Life</h1>
    <center>
    <h3>
    As high school ended, I knew that wasn't it, I had to continue my education, honestly I didn't have a choice, or I would have been just working at Mcdonalds the rest of my life. Something I didn't wanna do, although I do like their fries... However, I am currently attending Blackburn College and entering my sophomore year.  Blackburn College is about 1 hour and 15 minutes away from where I stay. It is located in Carlinville IL. I had many worries about college, although I knew basketball would be my comfort spot, I worried about things such as my roommate and us getting along, my classes and how tough they would be, and if I would feel miserable at times. These were all things that worried me mainly becuase I have never been actually on my own, and I knew the time would come and I would have to be prepared for it. When that day came, it wasn't so bad after all me and my roomate didn't link the first day or the second but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be either. During the first semester there were many thoughts going through my brain, "should I continue" "Is college really for me" but I realized that it all came from the depression of the school work. After while I soon got over it, and finsihed my first semester with a 3.3. Finals went good and everything else was coming along. I even worked in admission, so when there were times I needed to get caught up on work I would sometimes work on it there. Second semester came around and I was doing just fine finished with a 3.2 overall for my freshman year, after long nights and hours of studying, it all paid off. First year of college was pretty challenging, but I love challenges and I also love overcoming them.
